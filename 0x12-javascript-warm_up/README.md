# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Overview
This is the first project I have gotten in my ALX SE journey on JavaScript programming.I worked on various tasks that cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. These tasks helped me to understand the basics of scripting, working with variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more in Javascript.

By completing these tasks, I gained essential knowledge of JavaScript that can be applied to both scripting and web front-end development.

## Task Descriptions:

### Task 0: First constant, first print
- File: 0-javascript_is_amazing.js
- Description: Create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing" and print it using `console.log`.

### Task 1: 3 languages
- File: 1-multi_languages.js
- Description: Write a script that prints three lines: "C is fun," "Python is cool," and "JavaScript is amazing" using `console.log`.

### Task 2: Arguments
- File: 2-arguments.js
- Description: Write a script that prints a message based on the number of arguments passed. If no arguments are passed, print "No argument." If one argument is passed, print "Argument found." Otherwise, print "Arguments found."

### Task 3: Value of my argument
- File: 3-value_argument.js
- Description: Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it. If no arguments are passed, print "No argument."

### Task 4: Create a sentence
- File: 4-concat.js
- Description: Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it in the format "X is Y."

### Task 5: An Integer
- File: 5-to_integer.js
- Description: Write a script that prints "My number: <first argument converted in integer>" if the first argument can be converted to an integer. Otherwise, print "Not a number."

### Task 6: Loop to languages
- File: 6-multi_languages_loop.js
- Description: Write a script that prints three lines using a loop and an array of strings: "C is fun," "Python is cool," and "JavaScript is amazing."

### Task 7: I love C
- File: 7-multi_c.js
- Description: Write a script that prints "C is fun" x times, where x is the first argument of the script. If no argument is provided, print "Missing number of occurrences."

### Task 8: Square
- File: 8-square.js
- Description: Write a script that prints a square made of "X" characters. The size of the square is determined by the first argument. If no argument is provided or it cannot be converted to an integer, print "Missing size."

### Task 9: Add
- File: 9-add.js
- Description: Write a script that prints the addition of two integers. The integers are provided as the first and second arguments.

### Task 10: Factorial
- File: 10-factorial.js
- Description: Write a script that computes and prints the factorial of an integer provided as the argument. If no argument is provided, the factorial of NaN is 1. Use recursion to calculate the factorial.

### Task 11: Second biggest!
- File: 11-second_biggest.js
- Description: Write a script that searches for the second biggest integer in the list of arguments. If no arguments are provided or only one argument is given, print 0.

### Task 12: Object
- File: 12-object.js
- Description: Update the script to replace the value 12 with 89 in the `myObject` object.

### Task 13: Add file
